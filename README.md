# CIS-25-Final

## The Video Game

This final was mainly just about going through the experience of creating a video game. The game itself is a simple 2D spaceship shooter.
The learning process of doing this as a final was very tasking on its own. Of course, the person who created the Youtube video and resources for me to remake and have my computer compatabile
with this game is very proficient in making small video games. His GitHub name is Meemknight while some people who personally know him go by "Vlod" and watching his video in trying to make sense of me creating
.cpp files and .h header files vastly grew. From inputting/creating custom variables and defining what they do in various files to actually making quite a few custom libraries for the game to recall, use, and understand
what material or resources it needs to pull in order for the game to properly work.

The main files such as the Game Layer and its header alternative I remade into my own. Implimenting my own unique pathing for these files to commune with the images and to make the game run in debug mode (since I don't have an actual .exe app
to make it run). If you are looking to make a game similar to this or want to have the files to run this game, I recommend going to Meemknight's GitHub repository which I will post down below. Anyways, I hope you enjoy.

## What Else Do I Aim For?

This question comes in my head constantly, I look at different youtubers who have a profession in software engineer or some sort of tech background.
For me, video games are a great way to explore both from the technological stand point (the coding, bug tweaking, different softwares to use)
to the business and fincancial stand point (promoting, marketing, and scheduling partnerships)
and also having the artistic side (having a story/narritive, art, and animation).

I plan on becoming a "game developer" which has always been my dream.
