# CIS-25-Final

## The Video Game

For this final I decided to learn how to create, adjust/tweak, and understand to make a video game. This video game is a 2D flat spaceship shooter which is very fast pace the moment it boots up.
The learning process for this was actually quite tough due to the fact that this is my very FIRST C++ project diving into game development.
No, I don't have any prior experience to this. No, I didn't learn EVERYTHING about how the game completely works. BUT what I did learn was the different variables I had to creat and use.
I learned about the many headers and libraries that I had to use in order for the main to call those libraries when implimenting special functions.

With this being said, I also do a bit of graphic rendering with Blender. I've yet to create/sculpt models but I've learned through tutorials to make texture for many things (for now its just planets
environmental boxes for showcases and displays) but will continue to hone in and adapt onto many more cool things. Anyways, I hope whoever reads this does experience the wonders and creative spark in making vidoe games too!

## Giving Credit for Assets and Code

Take note that I personally do not own the right to ALL of the code for the video game. This was just to make a compatible version for MYSELF and learning how to make a video game in C++.
Proper credit goes to Meemknight aka "Vlod" who not only made the full course in making a c++ game like this but the code, the video, assets, and much more.
If you ever want to check him out his youtube, GitHub profile, and the project for this flat 2D space shooter will be below.
